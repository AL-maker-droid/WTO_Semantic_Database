Abstract. In this paper, an overview of domain optimization problems is given. The 
optimization problem in which an objecti ve function depending on a domain through the 
sol u tion of a boundar y val ue pro blem defined on the domain should be minimized (or 
maximized) with respect to the domain is called a domain optimization problem . Some 
examples of the optimization problems are given. For a simple domain optimization 
problem, the first order and the second order necessary conditions are derived. The 
existence of, and the numerica l methods for the optimal domain are briefly discussed. 
Keywords . Domain optimization ; distri bu ted parameter sytem; boundary-value problem ; 
first & second variation ; existence of the solution . 
INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview on 
"domain optimization problems" from the author's 
viewpoint . The domain optimizatio n problems have 
recently drawn interest on some investigato rs who 
wishes to design the shape of solid substances 
optimal in some sense. The objective function in 
these problems depends on the domain through not 
only the integration but also the solution of a 
boundary value problem defined on the domain; the 
optimization problems are, then, thought to be a 
kind of shape optimization problems. 
Examples of Domain Optimization Problems 
We shall give some typical examples of the domain 
optimization problems. Cea (1981) enumerates many 
such problems; the reader who is interested can 
consult his paper. 
Torsional rigidity , principal frequency. Polya 
(1948) completely solved the following optimization 
problems : 
Problem I (maximum torsional rigidity), minimize 
where r J 'Vu J2dx

A being determined together with the 
first problem is to find the shape minimum . The 
of the cross 
5 section of an elastic bar so that the torsion3l 
rigidity of the bar is maximized. The second one 
is to determine, for example, the shape of an 
elastic membrane which has the lowest principal 
tone. Polya gave the final answers to these 
problems using the Steiner 's symmetrization in 
isoperimetric problems; the optimal shapes are 
circles. Banichuk (1975) investigated the similar 
problems . 
~inimum-drag flow. Pironneau (1973, 1974) investi­
gated the shape design problem of minimum-drag 
flow. His problem is, for example, as follows: 
Let ~ be a domain in R3 bounded by two closed 
sufaces, Sand r, S being contained in rand r 
being fixed; minimize 
J 3 aUi aUj

... the Stokes equations with the pressure field p, a 
being a given velocity field at r. Pironneau gave 
a first order necessary condition to this problem. 
Koda (1984) considered the similar problem of 
non-stationary flow through his sensitivity analy­
sis. 
Miscellaneous problem s. From the shape design 
problem for plasma columns in toroidal devices for 
thermal nuclear fusion, the present author (1986a) 
was led to the following problem: Maximize 
J~g(X'U(X)) dx with respect to ~, 
where g(x,u) is a given function, ~ must satisfy 
for a given function h(x) 
J~h(X) dx = const.,

~(x,u) being an appropriate nonlinear function and 
being a given vector field. He defined 
anumbiguously the first variation of the solution, 
corresponding to domain variations, to the boundary 
value problem (9), (10). Then he derived the first 
order necessary condition in two ways of 
representation. 
He and his students (Fujii, rchikawa and Kozai, 
1985) showed an intuitive method for deriving the 
first order necessary condition as well as the 
first variation of the solution in the case of 
objective functions that depend on the gradient of 
the solution , Vu. 
Chenais (1975) transformed a domain identification 
problem with a boundary value problem of second 
kind into a domain optimization problem such as 
those described here and showed the existence of 
the optimal domain introducing a special class of 
domains . 
Zolesio (198Ib) investigated a kind of free bound­
Dry problems tranforming each of them into a domain 
optimization problem. 
Problem Statement 
Main features of the above problems lie on the fact 
that the objective function must be optimized with 
respect to the domain on which a boundary value 
problem is defined; in this regard, our problems 
are different from other shape optImIzatIon 
problems in which the domain is fixed (see, for 
exampLe, Sakawa and Ukai, 1980). In order to 
simply obtain an outline of the theory, we shall 
focus on the following simple (or prototype) 
probl em: 
Optimization problem . Given a smooth function 
g(x,u) of x = (XI, x2) E R2 and u E R, minimize 
J(O;u) defined by 
r 
J(O;u) = J g(x,u(x» dx o (I I) 
with respect to 0 in R2, subject to the subsidiary 
constraint 
reo) -J hex) dx = c( const.) , (12) o 
where u(x) is the solution of the boundary value 
problem 
6u(x) -k(x)u(x) = f(x), 
u(x) = K(const.), x E 0, 
x E 30. ( 13) 
(14) 
Throughout the paper, the given functions h(x)A 
k(x) ~ 0 and f(x) are assumed to be defined on RL 
and to be sufficiently smooth for the sake of 
simplicity. Note that (12) is a generalization of 
the condition that 0 has a prescribed area. 
FIRST ORDER NECESSARY CONDITION 
Definition of Boundary Variation 
In order to investigate the above Optimization 
problem, it is natural to consider variations of 
the preassigned domain O. These domain vriations 
are incarnated as variations of the boundary of 0, 
r = 30. Let pes) be a sufficiently smooth function 
of the arc1ength s introduced on r. He erect at 
each point on r the normal and plot on it the 
segment EP(s) s~ that positive Ep(s) lies on the 
outward normal n = (nI, n2), where E is a pOSitive 
number. If E is small enough, the end-points of 
the segments form a closed curve which enclose a 
new domain; hereafter, the curve will be denoted by 
rE and the new domain, 0E' He shall call Ep(s) the 
boundary variation and say that 0E(rE) is obtained from 0.(r) by this variation. 
First variation of the solution 
If we try to calculate the first variation of the 
objective function defined by (11) in accordance 
with the description of the conventional calculus 
of variation , we are inclined to know the first 
variation of the solution to (13), (14). Let u be 
the solution of E 
6UE(x) -k(x)uE(x) = f(x), x E 0E' (15) 
uE(x) = K, x ErE' (16) 
where r is 30. The solution u is different from 
u even In theE overlapped partE of the domains , 
0(\0 . Thus, the following question arises: Does 
ther~ exist a function ~ so that, roughly speaking , 
uE(x) -u(x) 
holds? Here a(E) is a quantity such that E-Ia(E) 
~ 0 as E ~ O. He call ~ the first variation of the 
solution . This notion will play a crucial role in 
calculation of the first variation of objective 
function J(O;u). 
For the boundary value problem (9), (10), the 
present author (1986a) showed the existence of the 
first variation ~ of the solution . As for the 
boundary value problem (13), (14), he has shown the 
following theorem in the coexisting paper (Fujii, 
1986b) . 
Theorem I. If we define $E(x) by 
~ (x) = E-I(U (x) -u(x», E E 
then there exists a function $ E CI(Q)IlC2(0) such 
that 
$, 
i, j = 1,2, 
uniformly on every compact subdomain of 0; in other 
words, 
Function $(x) is given as the solution of the 
boundary value problem: 
6$(x) -k(x)$(x) 0, x E 0, 
(j)( x) -~~ p(x), x Er. 
This theorem follows from the well-known maximum 
principle (Courant, 1962) and Schauder 's interio r 
estimates (Courant, 1962; Gilbarg and Trudinger, 
1983). 
First Order Necessary Condition 
Along the description of the conventional calculus 
of variation, we calculate the first variation of 
the objective function . Observe that J(OE;uE) is 
given by 
J(O ;u ) = J g(x,u (x» dx, E E 0 E 
E 
where, of course, 0 is obtained from 0 by boundary 
variation Ep(S) andEu is the solution of (15), 
(16). If we define the first variation 6(1)J by 
J(O ;u ) -J(O;u) = E6(1)J + a(E), (19) E E 

Domaill ()ptillli/atioll Problem, 7 
it is calculated to be 
6(1)j = Jrg(X,U)P(X) dr + Jrl~(X'U)<D(X) dx, (20) 
where Theorem I is 
O(x) from (20), 
through used. In order to eliminate 
function p(x) we introduce a 
d np(x) -k(x)p(x) = ~(x ,u(x» , x £ rl, (21) 
x Er, (22) p(x) = 0, 
obtaining 
( d 
J rl/u( x, u) <D( x) ( du dp 
dx = -J rdn dn p( x) d r. 
Substitution of this relation into (20) yields 
6(1)j = J r (g(x,u) -~ ~*} P(x) dr. (23) 
On the other hand, rl£ must satisfy (12). Hence, we 
have 
6(1 ) I = J rh (x) P( x) d r = 0, (24) 
where 6(1)1 is defined in the same manner as 6(I)j. 
If rl is the optimal domain of Optimization problem , 
6(I)j must vanish for an arbitrary pes) which 
satisfies (24). Thus, we arrived at the following 
theorem (Fujii, 1986b, see also 1986a). 
Theorem 2. Let rl be an optimal domain and u(x) be 
the corresponding solution . Then, there exists a 
constant A such that 
dp du g(x,u) -an an -Ah(x) = 0, x £ r (25) 
holds, where p(x) cs the solution of the boundary 
value problem (21), (22). 
The similar results are obtained by the present 
author and his students (Fujii, Ichikawa and 
Kozai, 1985) for other types of objective functions 
and subsidiary constraints. 
Alternative Approaches 
We shall briefly survey the alternative methods for 
deriving the first order necessary condition for 
optimality . 
Zolesio (1981a) introduced a time varying vector 
field V(t,x) in Rn to define a mapping Tt(V) in Rn 
by Tt(V): x + X(t,x), where X(t,x) is the solution 
of 
Q... X(t,x) dt 
X(O,x) V(t,X(t,x», 
x. 
Thus, Tt(V) represents a motion of the preassigned 
domain SI in such a way that each point x in rl is 
moved to a new point X(t,x). He calculated the 
derivatives of objective functions with respect to 
this motion assuming the existence of the first 
derivatives (these derivatives correspond to our 
first variation of the solutuion) of the solution 
to boundary value problems of various types. He 
called his method the material derivative method. 
This method is general and sophisticated . It 
seems, however , to be circumlocutory for our 
purpose since it is of no use to introduce motions 
of the interior points of rl. 
Rousselet (1982, 1983) introduced 
F(x) to define a mapping x + Q(x) 
neighbourhood of rl. He calculated 
of an objective function with 
mapping and derived the first a vector field 
= x + F(x) in a 
the sensitivity 
respect to this 
order necessary condition for optimality for vibrating membranes . 
Koda (1982, 1984) made use of the one parameter 
family of transformations found in the well-known 
book by Gelfand and Fomin (Gelfand and Fomin, 1963) 
to calculate the first variatior. of an objective 
function introducing adjoint variables ; he assumed 
tacitly the existence of the first variation of the 
solution however. He derived the first order 
necessary condition for the minimal drag shape in 
non-stationary flow of fluid. 
In order to derive the first order necessary 
condition for maximal torsional rigidity of elastic 
bars, Banichuk (1976) used specialty that the 
Euler-Lagrange equation for the objective function 
turns out to be the partial differential equation 
of the boundary value problem in the constraints . 
The present author (Fujii, 1985) used conformal 
mappings to calculate the first variation of an 
objective function in the case of Neumann problems; 
this method applies , of course, also to the case of 
Dirichlet problems . 
SECOND ORDER NECESSARY CONDITIO~S 
In order to decrease the number of candidates for, 
and to resarch features of the optimal domain, it 
is favorable to derive the second order necessary 
conditions . To this end, we shall first examine 
the second variation of the solution to the 
boundary value problem (13), (14). As far as the 
author knows, there is no paper except one by the 
present author (Fujii, 1986b) which deals with the 
second order necessary conditions together with the 
second variation of the solution for the domain 
optimization problems . 
Let rl be the domain obtained from 
variaEion £p(s) as in the previous

the second variation of the solution , where <D(x) is 
the first variation of the solution given in 
Theorem 1. Let us define wE(x) by 
w£(x) _ Cl(u£(x) -u(x) -£<I>(x», x £ rl(\rlE. 
Then, we have 
Theorem 3. For the sequence {w£}, there exists a 
function W £ CI(n)(\C2(rl) such that 
aWE aw a2w d2W 
WE + W, + E i = 1,2 axi aXi , -axiaxj -axiaxj' 
uniformly on every compact subdomain of rl. In 
other words, we have 
u£(x) -u(x) = E<I>(x) + £2w(x) + 0(£2), x £ rl!lrl£, 
where 0(£2) is a uniform estimate on every compact 
subdomain of rl()rl£. The function W(x) is given as 
the solution of 
nw(x) -k(x)W(x) 
w(x) au 
dn d<l> o -dn 0, x £ rl, (27) 
x £ r, (28) 
where u is the solution of (13) and (14), and <I> is 
given by Theorem I. 
Thus, the existence of the second variation W(x) of 
the solution is shown and the characterization of 

8 :\. Fujii 
\lJ(x) is given. 
It is possible, from Theorem 3, to calculate the 
second variation 6(2)j of the objective function 
defined by 
£6(I)j + £26(2)j + 0(£2). 
(29) 
The result reads 
6(2)j ; ~ Jr{~ g(x,u) + ~(x,u) ·~

defined to be positive when the curve

(31) 
where 6(2)1 is defined in the same manner as 6(2)j. 
If r2 is the optimal domain, 6(2)j given by (30) 
must be nonnegative for every pes) that satisfies 
(24) and (31). Hence we have the following second 
order necessary conditions of Kuhn-Tucker type for 
optimality . 
Theorem 4. Let r2 be a domain bounded by a smooth 
boundary . Necessary conditions that r2 attain a 
minimum to the optimization problem are that there 
exists a constant A (Lagrange multiplier) such that 
dU dP g(x,u) -an an -A hex) ; 0, x £ r (32) 
holds, and that, for every pes) which satisfies 
(24), 
(33) 
holds, where u(x) is the solution of (13),(14) and 
~(2)I' the solution of (21), (22), and 6(2)j, 
u( ) are given by (30), (31), respectively. 
Once we assume the existence of the second 
variation of the solution, it is now easy to 
derive the second order necessary conditions for 
other types of boundary value problems , objective 
functions and subsidiary constraints . For more 
detials, the reader should refer the coexisting 
paper (Fujii, 1986b). 
EXISTENCE OF THE OPTIi'IAL DOMAIN 
It is hopeless to show the existence of an optimal 
domain itself without imposing any condition on a 
class of domains in which we seek the optimal 
domain. Chenais (1975) introduced an important 
class of domains to prove the existence of an 
optimal domain in a certain domain optimization 
problem. The present author (Fujii, 1984) proved 
some lower-semicontinuity theorems for this class 
of domains to show the existence of the optimal 
domain for two kinds of boundary value problems . 
We shall briefly review these results . 
Chenais (1975) considered the following domain 
optimization problem : 
Let G and D be two bounded domains in Rn, Euclidean 
n-space, and let a given function f belong to L2(D) and ud be given in L2(G); find r2 (GC QC D) which 
minimizes j(Q) given by 
j(Q)" fG(U'G -Ud)2 dx, (34) 
where ulG is the restriction of u to G, and u is 
the solution of the boundary value problem 
6u(x) -u(x) ; f(x), x £ Q, (35) 
dU 0, x £ dQ, (36) do 
f(x) being a given function. 
He sought the optimal domain in the class of 
domains mentioned above deriving many important and 
useful properties of this class and proved the 
existence of the optimal domain; his objective 
function does not, however, depend on the gradien t 
of the solution, Vu. For the same class of 
domains, the present author (Fujii, 1984) derived 
some lower-semicontinuity theorems for objective 
functions that depend on the gradient of the 
solution , Vu. He showed, for example , the follow­
ing result. 
Theorem 5. 
continuous 
an optimal 
introduced Let a nonnegative function g(q) be 
in q £ R2 and convex. Then,there exists 
domain Q* in the class of domains 
by Chenais of the optimization problem: 
Hinimize r g(Vu(x)) dx with respect to Q in the 
)Q 
class, where u is the generalized solution of 
6u(x) -k(x)u(x) ; f(x), x £ Q, 
dU dii ; 0, x £ dQ 
and Q must satisfy 
JQh(X) dx ; c., (14) 
f(x) being a given smooth function of x £ R2. If 
Q* is smooth enough, the corresponding solution u* 
is the classical one; hence, the optimal domain 
exists in the classical sense. 
To his regret, however , his result for Dirichlet 
problem is not complete in the classical sense. 
In other words, the existence of the optimal domain 
for Optimization problem is not completely shown. 
This point should be overcome in the near future. 
NU~lERICAL HETHODS 
We can hardly expect analytiC solutions of the 
domain optimization problems except the special 
problems such as Polya's problems stated in the 
first section . Thus, it is desired , from the 
practical point of view, to develop numerical 
methods for solutions . 
Almost all the existing numerical methods (Cea, 
1981b; Pironneau, 1973; Koda, 1982,1984; Marrocco 
and Pironneau, 1978) are on the basis of the first 
variation of the objective function . Since these 
methods usually require many iterations of solving 
the boundary value problems , they are not thought 
to be much efficient . If we shall succede in 
making use of the second variation , stated above, 
of the objective function to derive the numerical 
methods like the Newtonian methods in the 
conventional mathematical programming, we are able 
to expect shortening of the computationa l times and 
the costs. 
In this case, however, if the problem enjoys 
symmetry such as symmetry of spatial rotation high 
and 

Domaill ()plimizal iOIl I'n .h!ems 
translation, we must add the, so 
"localization factor", for example 
a f~(XI2 + X22) dx to speak, 
to the objective function in order to confirm the 
convergence of the iteration s required, a being a 
weight. 
CONCLUDING RE~IARKS 
We have given an outline of the theory for the 
domain optimization problems that have a boundary 
value problem as a main constraint. For a linear 
boundary value problem ~ith a Dirichlet condition 
as an example, the existence of the first and the 
second variation, corresponding to a boundary 
variation, of the solution are established; they 
are shown to be given as solution s of boundary 
value problems of the same type. From these 
results, we were able to formulat e the first and 
the second variations of the objective function. 
The first order necessary condition derived in this 
paper is obtained also by other methods, for 
example, the material derivative method, the senSI­
tivity analysis, conformal mapping and so on. The 
second order necessary condition s of Kuhn-Tucker 
type has recently been derived by the present 
author. 
Many problems are left unsolved. We 
them from the theoretical point 
example, can enumerate 
of view: For 
1 complete existence theory for the optimal 
domain in the case of Dirichlet Problem; 
2 sufficient conditions for the optimal domain; 
3 properties, foreseen from the necessary condi­
tions, of the optimal diomain; 
4 analytic solutions of the optimal domain, if 
possible. 
From the practical point of view, the efficient 
numerical methods are desired first of all. 
For other boundary value problems such as Neumann 
problems, we can mention that it is easy to derive 
the first and the second order necessary conditions 
if we assume the existence of the variations of the 
solution and if the objective function does not 
depend on the gradient of the solution. 
If the investigation, including to settle those 
problems above, will be brought to succesive 
degrees of completion , the domain optimization 
method will find many application fields such as 
design problems in aeronauti cs.
