Demonstrating the Equivalence and
Efficiency of the Nested Model Compared
to a Single GE Model
Introduction
This document demonstrates that:
1. The nested model is an equivalent and ef ficient alternative to a single n-period GE model with
embedded climate policy
2. Solving the entire problem within a single GE model is computationally infeasible
Overview of the T wo Approaches
1. Nested Model (Current Approach)
Outer Loop:  Policy maker uses MCTS to optimize climate policy over n periods
Inner Loop:  Two-period GE model solves for equilibrium at each node
State T ransitions:  States update based on GE outcomes, damages, and learning
2. Single GE Model with Embedded Climate Policy
Objective Function:  Incorporates policy maker's objective directly over n periods
Agents and Firms:  Optimize over entire n-period horizon with endogenous policy
Equilibrium Concept:  DSGE model with embedded policy maker optimization
Theoretical Equivalence
Dynamic Programming Framework
Both approaches solve:

subject to:
Both models satisfy the Bellman equation, ensuring theoretical equivalence.
